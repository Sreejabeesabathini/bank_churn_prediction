Bank Churn Prediction
This project aims to predict whether a customer will stay with the bank or exit based on various customer-related features. The prediction is made using a machine learning model trained on customer data, 
including demographic details, financial statistics, and account activity.

Overview:
This project involves predicting bank churn — whether a customer will stay or leave the bank. By analyzing various customer attributes, the model helps the bank understand its customer base,
target at-risk customers, and ultimately reduce churn. The project uses data like customer demographics, account details, and activity history.

Features:
The model is built using the following features:
CreditScore: The credit score of the customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer (e.g., Male, Female).
Age: The age of the customer.
Tenure: Number of years the customer has been with the bank.
Balance: The account balance of the customer.
NumOfProducts: The number of products the customer has with the bank.
HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active member (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
EstimatedSalary: The estimated salary of the customer.
Geography_France: A binary indicator if the customer is from France (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
Geography_Germany: A binary indicator if the customer is from Germany (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
Geography_Spain: A binary indicator if the customer is from Spain (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
The target variable is Exited, where 1 indicates the customer has left the bank and 0 indicates the customer stayed.

Data:The dataset contains historical customer data from a bank. The data includes both categorical and numerical features. You can find a CSV file with this data, which includes columns for 
each feature mentioned above along with the target column Exited (1 for churned, 0 for staying).

Modeling
For this project, we will use machine learning algorithms to predict whether a customer will stay or exit. The modeling steps include:

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values.
Encoding categorical variables (such as Gender and Geography).
Normalizing numerical features (e.g., Age, Balance).
Feature Engineering:

Combining relevant features or creating new derived features.
Splitting the data into training and test sets.
Model Training:

Training a classification model using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.
Tuning hyperparameters and evaluating model performance.
Model Evaluation:

Using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.
Implementing cross-validation for model validation.
Evaluation
The model’s effectiveness is evaluated using standard classification metrics:

Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.
Precision: The ability of the model to avoid false positives.
Recall: The ability of the model to identify true positives.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.

Usage : Once the necessary libraries are installed, you can use the following steps to train and test the model:

Load Data:
Import the dataset (CSV) using pandas.
Preprocess Data:

Handle missing values:
Encode categorical variables using techniques such as One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.
Train Model:

Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Train your model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
Evaluate Model:

Use evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance on the test data.
